dupinator
=========

The original dupinator.py script was created by Bill Bumgarner.

This is the improved version created by Andrew Shearer.

It can also be found here:

The script is used to find duplicate files, taking care to use as little CPU as possible, thus only comparing files of the same size, then checking the first kb for differences, and after that creating a checksum of the whole file.
